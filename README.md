# Foo

Check if a sudoku puzzle is valid.

## Usage

We can validate a sudoku configuration (in a file) with the method `valid?` from the `Foo::Puzzle` class.

For example, given the file `valid_complete.sudoku` with the following content:

```
8 5 0 |0 0 2 |4 0 0
7 2 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 9
0 0 4 |0 0 0 |0 0 0
------+------+------
0 0 0 |1 0 7 |0 0 2
3 0 5 |0 0 0 |9 0 0
0 4 0 |0 0 0 |0 0 0
------+------+------
0 0 0 |0 8 0 |0 7 0
0 1 7 |0 0 0 |0 0 0
0 0 0 |0 3 6 |0 4 0
```

Then `Foo::Puzzle.new("valid_complete.sudoku").valid?` should return `true`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
